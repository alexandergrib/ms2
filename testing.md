# Code validation

## JSHINT code check

All of these *.js files below show undefined variables, those variables is defined in one .js and get called from another .js
file. This done to keep individual section of code separated for readability and keep files sizes low for faster loading.

- main.js
- map.js
- news.js
- weather.js

## HTML/CSS validation

- HTML validator results: No errors or warnings to show.
- CSS Validator results: Show 1 warning (Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes) this
  tells me that the validator doesn't check imported stylesheets(in my case, this is the google fonts import).
  


## Further Testing
- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Console output was used to test functions are working correctly during development stage. 
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

# Usability testing done by a real user

Testing performed by a real person who is asked to load the website for the fist time and to provide feedback from their
experience using the website.

### Case 1:

Assessment categories:

1. `Usabily`

    - Easy to understand what this site if for, updating all tabs to my selected city was easy and fast

2. `Quality`

    - Content is relevant to the selected location, website is not cluttered. Points of interest on the Maps allows to see
      the reviews ratings and click on the website link, taking me to the business' direct website to explore further if
  interested

3. `Responsivness`

    - Fast load of the data. Tried using the website on the mobile as well - all content aligned nicely, no overlaps.

4. `Stress test use cases`

    - Manually entered City incorrectly, entered City + the country in the search field incorrectly. Received a feedback
      reminding of the format to follow to search

5. `Strengths and weaknesses points`

    - Strengths - the website is clear and easy to use, data loads instantly. Weaknesses - additional functionality can be
      developed in the future to allow user to save places they are interested in visiting from the Entertainment tab

6. ` Any potential future additions or enhancements`
    - Would be great to see extended forecast in the weather for a chosen location, currently shows today's weather.
      Would like to see 3, 10-day forecast Ability to subscribe to the updates the website's content: example - email
      alerts when a new restaurant is added in my area.
      
        * `Noted for posible future website improvements`

### Case 2:

Assessment categories:

1. `Usabily`

    - Easy to use and intuitive design, minimalistic and simple which makes it easy to navigate across website for any age bracket and web experience.

2. `Quality`

    - I like the new colour palette if light blue and houses in the background compared to previous colour. The website feels light and user-friendly for usage. Logo and Local Spot name is also great, looks very legit. 
    -  I feel that there might be a room to enhance font even better and potentially remove the shade in the italic font text.

3. `Responsivness`

    - Fast load of the data. Tried using the website on the mobile as well - all content aligned nicely, no overlaps.

4. `Stress test use cases`

    - Entered city "Ashgabat" and noticed covid data has not been updated.
        * `This happens because API cannot recognize this country, or there no data in the database`

5. `Strengths and weaknesses points`

    - Strength: friendly UI, explicit navigation, not cluttered with many filters and sorting. Easy to use.
    - Weaknesses: no search/filter within each category (hotels - it shows me hotels based on Googleâ€™s choice, restaurants - same). Would be good to have one filter where user can apply them based on his preference. 
        * `Noted for posible future website improvements`
6. ` Any potential future additions or enhancements`
    - Reduce news font size in mobile version.
    - 7 days Weather forecast, to have ability to plan entertainment.
    - Transport section, add an option how to get there from my current location.
        * `Noted for posible future website improvements`.
